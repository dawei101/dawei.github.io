As engineers we sometimes recommend technologies, methodologies and approaches for solving
problems because deep down we want to have these on our resume and not because they are the
best solution for the problem. Such decisions very rarely result in happy outcomes.
The best thing for your career is a long string of happy customers eager to recommend you
because you did the right thing by them and for the project. This goodwill will serve you orders
of magnitude better than the latest shiny object in the latest shiny language or the latest shiny
paradigm. While it is important, even critical, to stay abreast of the latest trends and technologies
this should never happen at the cost of the customer. It‘s important to remember that you have a
fiduciary duty. As an architect you have been entrusted with the well-being of your organization
and its expected that you will avoid all conflicts of interest and give the organization your
undivided loyalty. If the project isn't cutting edge or challenging enough for your current career
needs then find one that is.

If you can't do that and you are forced to be in such a project, then you and everyone else will be
happier using the right technology for the customer rather than for your resume. It‘s often
difficult to resist utilizing a solution that is new and cool, even when it‘s inappropriate for the
current situation.
With the right solution, the project will have a happier team, a happier customer and overall far
less stress. This will often give you time to go deeper into the existing older technology or to
learn the new stuff on your own time. Or to go take that painting class you always wanted to do.
Your family will love you for it, too - they'll notice the difference when you get home.
Overall always put the customer's long-term needs ahead of your own short term needs and you
won't go wrong.

作为工程师，我们有时候我们推荐解决问题的技术、思想、方式方法，是因为我们的简历上有这些东西（我们更熟悉这些东西），而不是因为这是最好的解决方案。这样的决定很少能有好的结果。

工作中最棒的事情莫过于很多客户极力的推荐你，因为你为他们和他们的项目做了正确的事情。比起过去用个很牛的语言开或很牛的模式做出的很牛的东西，这样的信誉会对你的订单更重要。
